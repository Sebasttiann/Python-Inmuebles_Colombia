# Colombian real state market analysis
*   An exploration and cleaning of data is carried out about the households for sale in the city of Bogotá, Colombia.
*  The average area of all households for sale is determined
*  The average area of the top 10 households in all neighborhoods is determined and plotted. In addition, the mean, minimum and maximum value are known
*  I used the "Encuesta Multipropósito Bogotá - Cundimarca (EM 2021)" in order to build a machine learning-lineal regression model that predict the price of a house taking as inputs the UPZ code group, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, dummy for private residential and public record, and annual salary.
